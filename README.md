## What is mathieu?

mathieu is a series of apps that investigate [Mathieu functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_function). They're the counterparts to sine and cosine [eigenfunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenfunction) for the laplacian applied on a circle but instead for ellipses.
